# Aquaponics System Control

The provided code is an example of a simple web application for controlling an aquaponics system. Let's go through the code and understand its functionality:

## Dependencies

- `microdot`: A lightweight web framework
- `pandas`: A library for handling tabular data

## Initialization

- An instance of the `Microdot` class is created and assigned to the variable `app`.
- The default content type for responses is set to `'text/html'`.

## System State

- The variable `CSV_FILE` is set to `'state.csv'`, specifying the name of the CSV file used to store the system state.
- The `system_df` DataFrame is initialized with default values representing the initial state of the aquaponics system.

## Utility Functions

- `load_state_from_csv()`: Reads the system state from the CSV file and updates the global `system_df` DataFrame.
- `save_state_to_csv()`: Writes the current state of `system_df` to the CSV file.

## HTML Generation

- `htmldoc()`: Generates an HTML document as a string, representing the control interface and system parameters.

## Route Handlers

- `/`: The root URL route. Calls `control(request)` when a request is made. Saves the current state to the CSV file and generates the HTML document.
- `/toggle/<component>`: A route pattern that toggles the status of a specified component in the `system_df` DataFrame. Saves the updated state to the CSV file and generates the HTML document.
- `/set_parameter/<parameter>/<value>`: A route pattern that sets the value of a specified parameter in the `system_df` DataFrame. Saves the updated state to the CSV file and generates the HTML document.

## Application Execution

- The `app.run()` method is called to start the web application.
- The application listens for incoming requests on port 8008.

This code sets up a web application that allows users to control and monitor an aquaponics system through a web interface. Users can toggle the status of various components (water pump, air pump, light) and view system parameters (water level, temperature, pH level). The system state is stored in a CSV file, and the HTML document representing the system status is generated dynamically based on the current state.
