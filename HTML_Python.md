# Generating HTML using Python and f-strings

Python is not only a powerful programming language for data analysis and web scraping but also a versatile tool for generating HTML content. In this guide, we will demonstrate how you can use Python to generate HTML files using f-strings and the built-in print function.

## Understanding f-strings

F-strings in Python is a way of formatting strings using curly braces `{}` to insert expressions into string literals. The expressions will be replaced with their values when the string is printed or assigned.

```python
name = "Alice"
print(f"Hello, {name}")  # prints: Hello, Alice
```

## Creating a Basic HTML Template

You can create a basic HTML template as a multi-line f-string. This gives you a template you can fill in with your data.

```python
html_template = f"""
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>

</body>
</html>
"""
```

## Adding Elements to HTML

You can add HTML elements to your template by including variables in your f-string and assigning the HTML to those variables.

```python
header = "<h1>Welcome to my page</h1>"
paragraph = "<p>This is a paragraph of text on my page.</p>"

html_template = f"""
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
</head>
<body>
{header}
{paragraph}
</body>
</html>
"""
```

## Writing to HTML file

You can write your HTML to a file using the `print` function and redirection `file=open("filename", 'w')`.

```python
print(html_template, file=open("page1.html", 'w'))
```

This will create a new HTML file named "page1.html" in the current directory and write your generated HTML to it.

Using Python to generate HTML allows you to dynamically create web pages with data from your Python programs.
